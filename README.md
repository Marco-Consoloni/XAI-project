# Explainable AI (XAI) – Plant Disease Classification

This repository contains the Explainable AI (XAI) project, carried out as part of a 30-hour course in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (2023-2024) organized by:

- Department of Informatics, University of Pisa  
- National PhD Course in Artificial Intelligence

The course focuses on:
- Motivations behind XAI
- Core XAI methods and libraries
- Open research challenges in XAI

## Project Overview
We adress domain-specific problems:

- Early detection of plant diseases during initial phases of infection
- Detection on non-homogenous and complex backgrounds;
- Detection in single and multiple overlapping leaves

We trained different models for plant disease classification from images and compare them using post-hoc XAI techniques, including: **Integrated Gradients (IntGrad)**, **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**, **Grad-CAM++**.

These methods are used to highlight relevant image regions and analyze the decision-making process of the deep learning model adressing domain-specific problems:
